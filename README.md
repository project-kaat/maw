## Description

The **MAW** is a recursive acronym that stands for _Maw Attacks Wireless_.

This project is basically my research of IEEE802.11 security. The research is aiming to develop new tools for efficient, automated wardriving.

## What is done

1. Automated wardriving with hcxdumptool
2. Android app that relays phone's GPS data to a gpsd server
3. SQL database structure for storage of Access Point data, locations, hashes, and passwords
4. Automated scripts for interaction with the database (importing data, processing hashes, exporting to KML)

## What is planned

* Kismet integration
* Development of Kismet API client for active WiFi attacks
* Development of WPS active attack tool that operates on Access Points in parallel
